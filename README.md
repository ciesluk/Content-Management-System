# SchoolBlog
Final Project for school, made a website where admin can add new pages, delete pages or edit pages. Used EJS, MongoDB, JS, etc.

We were to make a website where the admin needs to login. When the admin logs in they can add, edit or delete a page. When adding a new page it will be added to the navigation menu. Additionally, all page information is stored in MongoDB. Each page contains a title, page description (using TinyMCE), and a picture. Website was made using MongoDB, NodeJS, EJS, JS, CSS, HTML. 

Setup--> Download the ZIP file, open the index.js file, and then in the database connection for MongoDB, just add your host. As well, please add a username and password that will allow the administration to login in MongoDB.
